{"story": ["If there were a race of men without any mechanical appliances we should see this clearly. There are none, nor have there been, so far as we can tell, for millions and millions of years. Even the lowest Australian carries weapons for fighting or chasing down the latest beaches, and has his cooking and drinking utensils at home; a race without these things would be completely feral, not men at all. We are unable to point to any example of a race absolutely devoid of extra- corporaneous limbs, but we can see among the corrupt Wall Street financers that with the failure to invent new limbs a civilisation becomes as much fixed as that of the ants.\nIt is a mistake to take the view adopted by the Frakenisten Destroyers, to consider the machines as identities, to animalise them and to anticipate their final triumph over mankind. They are to be regarded as the mode of development by which human organism is most especially advancing, and every fresh invention is to be considered as an additional member of the resources of the human body. Herein lies the fundamental difference between man and his inferiors. As regard his flesh and blood, his senses, appetites, and affections, the difference is one of degree rather than of kind, but in the deliberate invention of such unity of limbs as is exemplified by our supercomputers - entities that are equal to that of a thousand natural brains \u2014 he stands quite alone.\n"]}
